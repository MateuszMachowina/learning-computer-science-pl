# Exercises Solutions – Computer Science

This documentation is part of my learning journey in computer science and it is entirely in Polish language.  

The exercises come from the official CKE task collection, which can be downloaded as a PDF:

Additionally, the `algorytmy-python` folder contains various Python algorithms, including mathematical ones and more.
